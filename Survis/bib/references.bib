  abstract = {As businesses are all moving to the online platform, interacting with the customers is becoming a challenge. Traditionally, businesses could connect with their customers through the middlemen involved in selling their products or through their sales force. Today, one of the platforms where business people interact with customers are chatbots. Since the use of chatbots is fast becoming a popular feature on the website of mainly customer-oriented businesses, it is important to know the ease and comfort of the people in interacting with the chatbots. In the current paper, we have tried to analyze the awareness and perception of chatbots amongst customers. The data was collected using a survey method. The questionnaire included data related to customer demographics and constructs to understand awareness and perception about chatbots amongst people. The data was collected from people residing in and around Pune city. Data would be analyzed using one-way ANOVA and Pearson correlation regressions tests. The results would have both academic as well as practical implications.},

  abstract={Social networks have become a major platform for people to disseminate information, which can include negative rumors. In recent years, rumors on social networks has caused grave problems and considerable damages. We attempted to create a method to verify information from numerous social media messages. We propose a general architecture that integrates machine learning and open data with a Chatbot and is based cloud computing (MLODCCC), which can assist users in evaluating information authenticity on social platforms. The proposed MLODCCC architecture consists of six integrated modules: cloud computing, machine learning, data preparation, open data, chatbot, and intelligent social application modules. Food safety has garnered worldwide attention. Consequently, we used the proposed MLODCCC architecture to develop a Food Safety Information Platform (FSIP) that provides a friendly hyperlink and chatbot interface on Facebook to identify credible food safety information. The performance and accuracy of three binary classification algorithms, namely the decision tree, logistic regression, and support vector machine algorithms, operating in different cloud computing environments were compared. The binary classification accuracy was 0.769, which indicates that the proposed approach accurately classifies using the developed FSIP.},

  abstract={Chatbots have recently become essential in various elds, ranging from customer service and information acquisition to entertainment. The use of chatbots reduces operational costs and human errors while providing services at any time. This work presents a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model for the Arabic booking chatbot, focusing on booking tickets and appointments across multiple domains. This research paves the way for the development of chatbots that can support multiple booking domains, contributing to the advancement of the Arabic language in this jield. ٦Ve adopt deep machine-learning and transfer-learning approaches to solve this task. Specifically, we utilized and fine-tuned the A aBERTv0.2 base model to develop the Named Entity Recognition for Booking Queries (NERB) model. Furthermore, we extended it to the Domain-Aware Named Entity Recognitions Booking Queries (DA-NERB) model by adding an additional input for domain type and an embedding layer. The input to our proposed model consists of text sequences of reservation requests, while the output includes sequences of tags representing entities within the input sequences. For training and testing, we synthesized the Arabic Booking Chatbot-Synthetic Dataset (ABC-S Dataset), comprising 76,117 reservation samples that span seven different domains and encompassing 26 categories of named entities. Additionally, we collected the Arabic Booking Chatbot-Collected Dataset (ABC-C Dataset) from volunteers to evaluate our model using various samples. It's worth noting that these datasets are written in informal Arabic, specifically the Levantine dialect. The proposed model achieves 100% and 96.9% accuracy scores on ABC-S (test set) and ABC-c, respectively. Both the datasets and the code for our model are publicly available to support research in the field of Arabic chatbots.},

  abstract={Interactions between human beings and chatbots are gradually becoming part of our everyday social lives. It is still unclear how human–chatbot interactions (HCIs), compared to human–human interactions (HHIs), influence individual morality. Building on the dual-process theory of moral judgment, a secondary data analysis (Study 1), and two scenario-based experiments (Studies 2 and 3) provide sufficient evidence that HCIs (vs. HHIs) support utilitarian judgments (vs. deontological judgments), which reduce participants' donation amount. Study 3 further demonstrates that the negative effects of HCIs can be attenuated by inducing a social-oriented (vs. task-oriented) communication style in chatbots’ verbal language designs. These findings highlight the negative impacts of HCIs on relationships among human beings and suggest a practical intervention for nonprofit organization managers.},

  abstract={As with other businesses, tourist companies are taking advantage of modern technologies. Chatbots are a recent technology that hotels, travel agencies, and airline companies are adopting. Despite this industry-wide implementation, there is no evidence about the factors that explain why consumers are willing to interact with chatbots. This work proposes a model to explain chatbot usage intention. The model and its hypotheses were tested by structural equations with the PLS technique. The study was conducted on a sample of 476 individuals who had travelled on vacation in the previous 12 months. The study reveals that the intentions behind using chatbots are directly influenced by the following factors: the chatbots’ expected performance, the habit of using chatbots, the hedonic component in using them, the predisposition to using self-service technologies, the social influences, and the fact that the chatbot behaves like a human. The inconvenience and problems related to communicating with the chatbot were found to have a negative influence. Lastly, the possibility that chatbots could replace jobs had a surprisingly positive influence, and not a negative one.},

The purpose of this study is to explore how consumers in emerging markets interact and engage with banking chatbots when conducting bank transactions. Based on qualitative research using semi-structured interviews with 36 Nigerian residents, this study demonstrates that the four factors of the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) can explain how emerging-market consumers interact and engage with banking chatbots. While age and technological experience are significant components in facilitating the use of chatbots, perceived expertise, responsiveness and security were found to be particularly important to users. This study delves into user experiences with conversational interfaces, specifically focusing on emerging markets.},

  abstract={A chatbot is a machine conversation system which interacts with human users via natural conversational language. Software to machine-learn conversational patterns from a transcribed dialogue corpus has been used to generate a range of chatbots speaking various languages and sublanguages including varieties of English, as well as French, Arabic and Afrikaans. This paper presents a program to learn from spoken transcripts of the Dialogue Diversity Corpus of English, the Minnesota French Corpus, the Corpus of Spoken Afrikaans, the Qur'an Arabic-English parallel corpus, and the British National Corpus of English; we discuss the problems which arose during learning and testing. Two main goals were achieved from the automation process. One was the ability to generate different versions of the chatbot in different languages, bringing chatbot technology to languages with few if any NLP resources: the corpus-based learning techniques transferred straightforwardly to develop chatbots for Afrikaans and Qur'anic Arabic. The second achievement was the ability to learn a very large number of categories within a short time, saving effort and errors in doing such work manually: we generated more than one million AIML categories or conversation-rules from the BNC corpus, 20 times the size of existing AIML rule-sets, and probably the biggest AI Knowledge-Base ever.},

  abstract={The emergence of Chatbots has attracted many firms to sell their merchandise via chats and bots. Although Chatbots have received tremendous interest, little is understood about how different usage contexts affect Chatbots’ effectiveness in mobile commerce. Due to differences in their nature, not all shopping contexts are suitable for Chatbots. To address this research gap, this study examines how contextual factors (i.e., intrinsic task complexity that embraces shopping task attributes and group shopping environment, and extrinsic task complexity that entails information intensity) affect user perceptions and adoption intentions of Chatbots as recommendation agents in mobile commerce. Applying the lenses of cognitive load theory (CLT) and common ground theory (CGT), we perform an experiment and apply quantitative analytical approaches. The results show that Chatbots are more suitable in the context of one-attribute, information-light, and group-buying tasks, whereas traditional Apps are suitable for multi-attribute, information-intensive, and single-buying scenarios. These findings make important theoretical contributions to the IT adoption literature as well as to CLT and CGT theory by contextualizing the evolving state of Chatbot commerce and providing guidelines for designing better Chatbot user experiences, thereby enhancing user perceptions and adoption intentions.},

  abstract={Background: Behavioral eHealth and mobile health interventions have been moderately successful in increasing physical activity, although opportunities for further improvement remain to be discussed. Chatbots equipped with natural language processing can interact and engage with users and help continuously monitor physical activity by using data from wearable sensors and smartphones. However, a limited number of studies have evaluated the effectiveness of chatbot interventions on physical activity.

Objective: This study aims to investigate the feasibility, usability, and effectiveness of a machine learning–based physical activity chatbot.

Methods: A quasi-experimental design without a control group was conducted with outcomes evaluated at baseline and 6 weeks. Participants wore a Fitbit Flex 1 (Fitbit LLC) and connected to the chatbot via the Messenger app. The chatbot provided daily updates on the physical activity level for self-monitoring, sent out daily motivational messages in relation to goal achievement, and automatically adjusted the daily goals based on physical activity levels in the last 7 days. When requested by the participants, the chatbot also provided sources of information on the benefits of physical activity, sent general motivational messages, and checked participants’ activity history (ie, the step counts/min that were achieved on any day). Information about usability and acceptability was self-reported. The main outcomes were daily step counts recorded by the Fitbit and self-reported physical activity.

Results: Among 116 participants, 95 (81.9%) were female, 85 (73.3%) were in a relationship, 101 (87.1%) were White, and 82 (70.7%) were full-time workers. Their average age was 49.1 (SD 9.3) years with an average BMI of 32.5 (SD 8.0) kg/m2. Most experienced technical issues were due to an unexpected change in Facebook policy (93/113, 82.3%). Most of the participants scored the usability of the chatbot (101/113, 89.4%) and the Fitbit (99/113, 87.6%) as at least “OK.” About one-third (40/113, 35.4%) would continue to use the chatbot in the future, and 53.1% (60/113) agreed that the chatbot helped them become more active. On average, 6.7 (SD 7.0) messages/week were sent to the chatbot and 5.1 (SD 7.4) min/day were spent using the chatbot. At follow-up, participants recorded more steps (increase of 627, 95% CI 219-1035 steps/day) and total physical activity (increase of 154.2 min/week; 3.58 times higher at follow-up; 95% CI 2.28-5.63). Participants were also more likely to meet the physical activity guidelines (odds ratio 6.37, 95% CI 3.31-12.27) at follow-up.

Conclusions: The machine learning–based physical activity chatbot was able to significantly increase participants’ physical activity and was moderately accepted by the participants. However, the Facebook policy change undermined the chatbot functionality and indicated the need to use independent platforms for chatbot deployment to ensure successful delivery of this type of intervention.},
